It advises that if there is a genuine police emergency, the person should call '999' again or send an SMS to '70999'. The SMS also warns that making silent calls to '999' is an offence and may lead to prosecution, as such calls impede the SPF from performing its duties and may put lives at risk.\n\nVerification from the official Singapore Police Force website confirms that SMS 70999 is a legitimate emergency SMS service for situations where it is unsafe or impossible to speak when calling '999'. The service is free to use, though normal SMS charges apply. Additionally, Singapore law under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act 1906 criminalizes making harassing or silent calls to emergency numbers, with penalties including fines and imprisonment.\n\nThe SMS sender ID 'POLICE 999' and the content align with official communications from the Singapore Police Force. The warning about silent calls being an offence is consistent with Singapore's legal framework and police advisories.\n\nConclusion: The SMS is a legitimate and official communication from the Singapore Police Force. The advice and warnings it contains are accurate and should be heeded to avoid legal consequences and to ensure emergency services are not hindered.",

The link format \"diags://\" is not a legitimate Apple URL scheme, and attempts to verify the URL's safety failed due to its invalid format.\n\nOfficial Apple guidance warns against phishing messages that impersonate Apple or other legitimate companies, urging users not to click on suspicious links or provide personal information. The official Apple support page on social engineering and phishing scams confirms that such messages are common social engineering attempts designed to steal personal data or install malware.\n\nConclusion: The SMS is a scam and should not be trusted. Recipients should not click on the link or reply to the message. Instead, they should delete the message and report it to relevant authorities or Apple support channels.

The official election timeline is well-documented and publicly available on the ELD website and major news sources.\n\nThe logo shown in the message is the official Elections Department Singapore logo, but the dates provided are inaccurate and do not match the official election schedule for 2025.\n\nConclusion: The forwarded message contains incorrect information about the 2025 Singapore election dates. The official election dates are earlier in April and May 2025, with Polling Day on 3 May 2025, not 10 May 2025.

However, official and credible sources including the Elections Department Singapore (ELD) and major news outlets indicate different dates for the 2025 General Election. The official Writ of Election issued by the President states Nomination Day as 23 April 2025, with Polling Day on 3 May 2025. The campaign period starts immediately after Nomination Day and ends on the day before Polling Day, which is Cooling-off Day. Campaigning is prohibited on Cooling-off Day to allow voters time to reflect.\n\nMultiple reliable sources including the ELD website, The Straits Times, and Channel News Asia confirm these dates. There is no official information supporting the dates in the submitted content. Therefore, the dates provided in the content are inaccurate and do not reflect the official election timeline for 2025 in Singapore.\n\nConclusion: The election dates in the content are incorrect. The official 2025 Singapore General Election dates are Nomination Day on 23 April 2025, Campaign period from 23 April to 1 May 2025, Cooling-off Day on 2 May 2025, and Polling Day on 3 May 2025. Voters and interested parties should rely on official sources such as the Elections Department Singapore for accurate election information.",

                "en": "The content in the Instagram post alleges that Ng Chee Meng, a Singaporean labour chief, was having a private dinner with Su Haijin, a convicted member of the Fujian gang involved in billion-dollar money laundering. The post claims this meeting was part of a money laundering operation and that Ng Chee Meng is a puppet of Lee Hsien Loong.\n\nCredible news sources, including Channel News Asia (CNA) and The Straits Times, have reported on the photos of dinners involving Ng Chee Meng, other ministers, and Su Haijin. These reports confirm that the dinners did take place but clarify the context:\n- The dinners complied with COVID-19 measures at the time.\n- Ng Chee Meng and other ministers met Su Haijin at engagements or dinners but had no further interactions with him after learning about police investigations.\n- The ministers and Ng Chee Meng stated they did not know Su Haijin personally and had no dealings with him before or after these occasions.\n- The man in the photo with Su Haijin was wrongly identified in some social media posts as a Wilmar chairman, which was corrected by The Straits Times.\n- Ng Chee Meng and other ministers emphasized that these meetings were part of their official duties engaging with various companies and private sector leaders.\n\nThe Instagram post's claims about Ng Chee Meng being a puppet or involved in money laundering are unsubstantiated and contradicted by official statements and reputable news reports. The photos are real but taken out of context to imply wrongdoing.\n\nConclusion: The Instagram post contains misleading information by falsely associating Ng Chee Meng with criminal activities based on a photo of a dinner meeting. Verified news sources confirm the meetings occurred but deny any improper conduct or ongoing relationships with Su Haijin. The post should be regarded as misinformation.",

It details locations, time slots, previous charges, and new charges.\n\nUpon verification with multiple reliable sources including the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and reputable Singaporean transport information websites, the specific charges and time slots in the image do not match the latest official ERP rates and timings for 2025. Official updates from LTA indicate different charge amounts and time slots, with some locations showing higher or different rates than those in the image. For example, the CTE northbound before Braddell Road typically has higher charges during peak hours than shown, and the KPE northbound after Defu Flyover has different charge timings and amounts.\n\nThe image appears to be an outdated or inaccurate representation of ERP charges. For accurate and current ERP rates, it is recommended to refer directly to the official LTA website or trusted Singaporean transport information portals.\n\nConclusion: The table in the image is not a reliable source for current ERP charges and should not be used for planning or reference. Always consult official or updated sources for ERP information in Singapore.",

This surge in flu vaccine appointments was reported to have occurred on February 4, 2025, one day after the announcement of her death. The Ministry of Health (MOH) in Singapore confirmed the increase in demand and assured that there is sufficient stock of the influenza vaccine available.

Recent credible sources indicate that the collapse of many religious and historic buildings in Myanmar, including temples, is primarily due to a powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck central Myanmar on March 28, 2025. This earthquake caused widespread destruction of cultural and religious sites across the country. There is no verified evidence linking the temple collapse directly to military actions or the coup itself. However, the military coup in Myanmar since 2021 has led to widespread violence and atrocities, which is a separate but concurrent crisis.\n\nThe Facebook post linked to the image is from a private group and the original content is no longer available, limiting verification from that source. The image and message appear to be used to highlight the broader suffering in Myanmar, but the temple collapse is best attributed to natural disaster rather than military violence.\n\nIn conclusion, while the military coup has caused significant turmoil and human rights abuses in Myanmar, the specific temple collapse shown in the image is most likely a result of the recent major earthquake, not direct military action.",

                "en": "The content concerns the legitimacy of text messages purportedly from the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board in Singapore. Official CPF sources clarify that legitimate communications from the CPF Board will only come through specific channels: calls from the number 6227 1188, SMS messages sent from a \"gov.sg\" sender ID, emails ending with @cpf.gov.sg or @e.cpf.gov.sg, and WhatsApp messages from the verified \"CPF Board Text Us\" account with a blue badge and a specific phone number. \n\nThe CPF Board warns against scammers impersonating government officials who may use personal information to appear legitimate and request sensitive details or money transfers. CPF officials will never ask for bank login details, request money transfers, or ask to install unofficial apps. Recipients are advised to end conversations immediately if such requests occur and report to the 24/7 ScamShield anti-scam helpline or CPF official hotline.\n\nAdditional guidance from government and news sources emphasizes that all SMSes from government agencies now use the \"gov.sg\" sender ID to help the public verify authenticity. The SMS will include the full name of the agency, a signature indicating it is an automated message from the Singapore Government, and will not ask for sensitive information or money transfers.\n\nIn conclusion, a CPF text message is true and legitimate only if it meets the official criteria: sender ID is \"gov.sg\", the message content is consistent with official communication, and no requests for sensitive personal or financial information are made. Any deviation from these should be treated as suspicious and reported accordingly.",

The official Aramex app is available through recognized platforms such as Google Play Store and Apple App Store under the aramex.com domain or official app listings.\n\nConclusion: The message is suspicious due to the use of a non-official domain (armx.me) for app download and the inability to access the official Aramex app page.

However, a search for this name and related details shows no credible or official police sources confirming such a wanted notice. The only relevant results pertain to a different individual named Charles Yeo, a lawyer wanted for unrelated legal issues, not the crimes described in the image. The official Singapore Police Force website and trusted news sources do not list any wanted notice matching the details in the image. Additionally, the image was flagged on a fact-checking platform as likely harmful or untrue.\n\nConclusion: The wanted notice in the image is not verified by official police sources and appears to be false or misleading. It is advised not to share or act on this image without confirmation from official Singapore Police Force channels. For any genuine police alerts, always refer to official government or police websites and communications.",

Chan School of Public Health, and Singapore's HealthXchange indicate that bananas are rich in several key nutrients, notably potassium, vitamin B6, vitamin C, dietary fiber, and manganese.\n\nBananas are particularly known for their high potassium content, which is essential for heart health, blood pressure regulation, and proper muscle and nerve function. They also provide vitamin B6, which supports red blood cell production, metabolism, and nervous system health. Additionally, bananas offer vitamin C, manganese, and dietary fiber, which aid in immune function, skin health, digestion, and protection against oxidative stress.\n\nTherefore, if a doctor advises eating more bananas, it is likely to address deficiencies or needs related to potassium, vitamin B6, or dietary fiber. Bananas can also help with gastrointestinal issues such as constipation due to their fiber content.\n\nIn conclusion, the recommendation to eat more bananas typically relates to increasing intake of potassium, vitamin B6, and fiber, which are important for cardiovascular health, metabolism, and digestive health.",

                "en": "The image shows SMS messages from a sender labeled \"Likely-SCAM\" containing verification codes and warnings about not sharing OTPs (One-Time Passwords). The messages mention TikTok and GCash, with repeated warnings not to share OTPs on social media, SMS, or email links.\n\nAnalysis:\n1. TikTok Verification Code Messages: Legitimate TikTok verification codes are sent to users when they attempt to log in or verify their account. TikTok advises users never to share these codes with others. Receiving such a code without requesting it may indicate someone else is trying to access the account, but the message itself is typically legitimate if it comes from TikTok.\n\n2. GCash OTP Messages: Multiple sources confirm that scammers often use SMS spoofing to send fake OTP messages pretending to be from GCash. GCash officially warns users that it will never ask for MPIN or OTP via SMS or email links and advises users not to share these codes. The repeated messages in the image are consistent with scam attempts or spoofed messages.\n\n3. The sender ID \"Likely-SCAM\" suggests the phone or service provider has flagged these messages as suspicious, which aligns with the known prevalence of OTP scams and spoofing.\n\nConclusion:\nThe TikTok verification code message may be legitimate if the user requested it, but caution is advised if unsolicited. The GCash OTP messages are likely spoofed scam messages, as GCash does not request OTPs via SMS in this manner. Users should never share OTPs or MPINs and should treat such messages with suspicion, especially if unsolicited or repeated. The labeling of the sender as \"Likely-SCAM\" further supports the conclusion that these messages are suspicious and potentially part of a scam attempt.",

The site is known for its controversial and critical views on Singaporean politics and society. It is not an official or government-affiliated source but rather an independent commentary platform. The website and its author have been subjects of debate and criticism within Singapore, with some questioning the influence and intentions behind the content.\n\nThe article itself presents opinions and analysis rather than verified facts or official statements. It includes political commentary and critiques of government communication strategies, which reflect the author's personal viewpoints.\n\nThe URL is benign and not malicious, but the content should be understood as opinion-based political commentary rather than authoritative or official information.\n\nIn conclusion, the article from critical.sg provides a perspective on Singapore's political communication but should be read with caution, recognizing it as an independent opinion piece rather than an official or fully factual source. Readers should cross-reference with official government communications or reputable news sources for verified information.",

The URLs were checked and found to be benign, indicating no immediate malicious content detected on the linked pages. However, the screenshots of these URLs show only a generic Singtel footer with no visible promotional content, which is suspicious.\n\nA search for \"Singtel Mo4U NDP Giveaway scam\" reveals multiple scam advisories from Singtel and news sources warning about phishing and scam messages impersonating Singtel and using giveaways as bait. These scams often redirect victims to fake websites to steal personal information or financial details.\n\nGiven the context and the common scam patterns involving Singtel impersonation and giveaways, these messages are highly likely to be part of a phishing or scam attempt despite the benign URL check. The lack of legitimate promotional content on the linked pages further supports this conclusion.\n\nConclusion: The messages claiming free beauty gift sets from Singtel Mo4U are very likely scams. Recipients should not click on the links or provide any personal information. Official Singtel promotions would typically be communicated through verified channels and contain clear branding and details. Exercise caution and verify with official Singtel sources if in doubt.",

However, multiple credible sources, including an official CapitaStar Facebook post, warn of ongoing scams where fraudsters impersonate CapitaStar representatives to steal sensitive or financial information. These scams often involve fake emails or messages promising prizes or exclusive offers.\n\nThe official CapitaStar Facebook page explicitly cautions members about fake accounts and unsolicited communications claiming to be from CapitaStar, advising recipients to verify legitimacy by contacting CapitaStar directly via their official email.\n\nConclusion: The email in the image is highly likely to be a scam impersonating CapitaStar and London Weight Management to lure recipients into providing personal information. Recipients should not click on any links or provide any details. Verification should be done through official CapitaStar channels only. This type of message is a known scam targeting CapitaStar members.",

Recipients who believe they are affected should verify their status through official channels and consider filing claims before the stated deadlines. Caution is advised to avoid sharing sensitive information outside the official settlement process.\n\nSources include news articles from USA Today, NBC Chicago, and legal class action settlement sites.",

Varying amounts of Private Information of customers and guests of MGM were accessed in the Data Incidents. The Private Information included names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and, for a smaller number of individuals, drivers’ license numbers, passport numbers, and Social Security numbers.

The Settlement Class includes all persons in the United States whose Private Information was compromised as a result of the Data Incidents and who were sent notice by the Defendant of the Data Incidents. \n\nWhat does the Settlement Provide?  \n\nDocumented Loss Cash Payment. \nYou may submit a timely and valid Claim Form and provide supporting documentation that you spent money or incurred losses related to the Data Incident for up to $15,000.00. Please visit the website for information and examples on how to file for a Documented Loss Cash Payment.\n \nUse this unique ID number 699CTT67D7 and PIN 2556 to file your Claim online. \n\nYour Cash Payment amount may be subject to a pro rata (a legal term meaning equal share) increase if the amount of Valid Claims received is insufficient to exhaust the entire Settlement Fund. Similarly, in the event the amount of Valid Claims exhausts the amount of the Settlement, the amount of Cash Payments may be reduced pro rata accordingly.  \n\nFinancial Account Monitoring.\nIn addition to the Cash Payments, you can file a Claim for one year of three-bureau identity theft protection, Financial Account Monitoring, and at least $1,000,000 of fraud/identity theft insurance.\n\nAll Settlement Class Members are eligible to file a Claim for Financial Account Monitoring and a Documented Loss Cash Payment, but not every Settlement Class Member is eligible to file a Claim for a Tiered Cash Payment. \n\nYou must submit a timely and valid Claim Form online here or by mail postmarked by June 3, 2025. \n\nOther Options. If you do not want to be legally bound by the Settlement, you must opt out of the Settlement no later than May 19, 2025. If you do not opt out, you will give up the right to sue and will release the Defendant and Released Parties about the legal claims in the lawsuits. If you do not opt out, you may object to the Settlement by May 19, 2025. The Long-Form Notice on the Settlement Website has instructions on how to opt out or object. If you do nothing, you will get no Settlement Class Member Benefits, and you will be bound by the Settlement and any judgments and orders. The Court will hold a Final Approval Hearing on June 18, 2025, to consider whether to approve the Settlement and Class Counsel’s request for attorneys’ fees of up to 30% of the $45 million Settlement Fund, and reimbursement of their litigation costs.

This is not a solicitation from a lawyer.\n\nYou can learn more at: www.MGMDataSettlement.com\nA $45 million Settlement has been reached in two class action lawsuits against MGM Resorts International (“MGM” or “Defendant”) arising out of two Data Incidents, one that occurred in or around July 2019, and a second separate Data Incident that occurred in or around September 2023 (together, the “Data Incidents”). Varying amounts of Private Information of customers and guests of MGM were accessed in the Data Incidents. The Private Information included names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and, for a smaller number of individuals, drivers’ license numbers, passport numbers, and Social Security numbers. Only certain people had their Social Security numbers, passport numbers, and/or drivers’ license numbers exposed.\n\nThe purpose of this Notice is to provide information about this Settlement and explain your rights and options.\n\nWho is Included? You are receiving this Email Notice because data provided by MGM indicates your information was included in one of the Data Incidents and you are a Settlement Class Member. The Settlement Class includes all persons in the United States whose Private Information was compromised as a result of the Data Incidents and who were sent notice by the Defendant of the Data Incidents. \n\nWhat does the Settlement Provide?  \n\nDocumented Loss Cash Payment. \nYou may submit a timely and valid Claim Form and provide supporting documentation that you spent money or incurred losses related to the Data Incident for up to $15,000.00. Please visit the website for information and examples on how to file for a Documented Loss Cash Payment.\n \nUse this unique ID number 699CTT67D7 and PIN 2556 to file your Claim online. \n\nYour Cash Payment amount may be subject to a pro rata (a legal term meaning equal share) increase if the amount of Valid Claims received is insufficient to exhaust the entire Settlement Fund. Similarly, in the event the amount of Valid Claims exhausts the amount of the Settlement, the amount of Cash Payments may be reduced pro rata accordingly.  \n\nFinancial Account Monitoring.\nIn addition to the Cash Payments, you can file a Claim for one year of three-bureau identity theft protection, Financial Account Monitoring, and at least $1,000,000 of fraud/identity theft insurance.\n\nAll Settlement Class Members are eligible to file a Claim for Financial Account Monitoring and a Documented Loss Cash Payment, but not every Settlement Class Member is eligible to file a Claim for a Tiered Cash Payment. \n\nYou must submit a timely and valid Claim Form online here or by mail postmarked by June 3, 2025. \n\nOther Options. If you do not want to be legally bound by the Settlement, you must opt out of the Settlement no later than May 19, 2025. If you do not opt out, you will give up the right to sue and will release the Defendant and Released Parties about the legal claims in the lawsuits. If you do not opt out, you may object to the Settlement by May 19, 2025. The Long-Form Notice on the Settlement Website has instructions on how to opt out or object. If you do nothing, you will get no Settlement Class Member Benefits, and you will be bound by the Settlement and any judgments and orders. The Court will hold a Final Approval Hearing on June 18, 2025, to consider whether to approve the Settlement and Class Counsel’s request for attorneys’ fees of up to 30% of the $45 million Settlement Fund, and reimbursement of their litigation costs. Class Counsel will also seek Service Awards for the Class Representatives. You or your lawyer may attend and ask to appear at the hearing, but you are not required to do so. The hearing may be held remotely, and if so, instructions will be at www.MGMDataSettlement.com.\n\nThis notice is a summary. Learn more about the Settlement here or call toll free 1-888-899-8358.",

                "en": "The claim that ERP (Electronic Road Pricing) rates in Singapore will increase in May 2025 is false. Official information from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) confirms that the latest ERP rate revision will take effect from 1 September 2025, not May. The LTA's announcement dated 27 August 2025 states that ERP rates will be increased by $1.00 at five specific locations during certain time periods starting September 1, 2025. There are no official announcements or credible sources supporting an ERP rate increase in May 2025. Additionally, multiple sources including news outlets and official LTA statements have debunked rumors of ERP hikes in June or May 2025 as fake news. \n\nIn conclusion, any message or claim about ERP rates going up in May 2025 is inaccurate and should be disregarded. The next scheduled ERP rate adjustment is in September 2025 as per LTA's official release.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2025/8/news-releases/revised-erp-rates-from-1-september-2025.html\n- https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/reports-of-erp-hikes-from-june-fake-lta\n- https://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/singapore-lta-slams-false-reports-040941236.html\n- https://www.tnp.sg/news/reports-erp-hikes-june-fake-lta",

                "en": "The content concerns Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's justification of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) increase, which has faced criticism from netizens who argue that the hike could have been delayed due to already high prices and economic burdens. Official sources such as The Straits Times confirm that Lawrence Wong has explained the GST increase as necessary to close the gap between government revenue and expenditure until 2030, and that the increase is not the key driver of inflation but a \"once-off\" impact. The GST hike is part of a broader fiscal strategy to meet rising healthcare and social spending needs. Netizens' pushback reflects concerns over the timing and impact of the tax increase on cost of living, but the government maintains the hike is essential for sustainable public finances.\n\nTheOnlineCitizen article linked is accessible but requires human verification to view. The site is classified as benign and not malicious. The information aligns with credible news sources, indicating the GST increase justification by Lawrence Wong is factual, while public dissent is a common response to tax hikes.\n\nIn conclusion, the GST increase justification by Lawrence Wong is supported by official statements and credible news reports. The netizens' view that the hike could have been delayed represents a public opinion rather than a factual inaccuracy. The content is legitimate and reflects ongoing public discourse on fiscal policy in Singapore.",

However, the image itself does not match typical scenes of ATM queues and seems to be a generic crowd photo.\n\nAdditionally, the image is associated with a sponsored advertisement from a website \"skylineup.top,\" which was flagged as suspicious with a high maliciousness score (0.81). This suggests the source or advertisement linked to the image may not be trustworthy.\n\nIn conclusion, while queues at ATMs in Singapore do happen during certain occasions, the image provided does not appear to be an authentic or accurate representation of such an event.

The Facebook page indicates it is an education website with contact details based in the UK, and the LinkedIn profile shows a small company size (2-10 employees) focused on e-learning.\n\nSearch results show multiple reviews on platforms like Trustpilot and FindCourses.co.uk, generally positive, highlighting efficient service and quality training. The company offers nationally and internationally recognized courses, with a focus on assessor training and leadership in adult care.\n\nThe Instagram link provided redirects to a login page, so no direct content verification was possible there.\n\nIn conclusion, iSuccessAcademy appears to be a legitimate online training provider with a credible digital footprint and positive user reviews. However, the main operational base seems to be in the UK rather than Singapore, which is relevant for users seeking local accreditation or support.

                "en": "The content concerns reports that Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma has been implicated in an intimidation campaign orchestrated by the Chinese regime. Multiple credible sources, including The Guardian, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), and Rediff, report that Jack Ma was allegedly used by Chinese authorities to pressure a businessman, a China-born Singapore citizen, to return to China to assist in the prosecution of an out-of-favour former Chinese official, Sun Lijun. The reports detail how the Chinese government employed various coercive tactics, including threats of extradition and psychological pressure, to achieve their objectives. Jack Ma's involvement appears to be part of a broader campaign by the Chinese regime to target dissenters and consolidate control.\n\nThe Guardian article provides an in-depth analysis of the intimidation campaign, highlighting the use of international law enforcement mechanisms and the psychological warfare employed. The ICIJ report corroborates these findings, emphasizing the exploitation of Interpol and other international tools by Chinese authorities. The Rediff article summarizes the situation, confirming the key points about Jack Ma's role and the broader context of the campaign.\n\nThese reports come from reputable international news organizations and investigative journalism groups known for their rigorous standards and credibility. The information aligns across multiple independent sources, lending strong credibility to the claims.\n\nIn conclusion, the information that Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma was implicated in an intimidation campaign by the Chinese regime is supported by credible and well-established news sources. The reports provide a detailed and consistent narrative about the involvement of Jack Ma in pressuring a businessman to aid the Chinese government in prosecuting a former official, reflecting a broader pattern of political repression by the Chinese authorities.",

                "en": "The message states that a driver has a message about your order and instructs to reply STOP to stop receiving texts from Amazon for deliveries and pickups, with a note that the parcel is outside the door. This type of message is commonly associated with Amazon delivery notifications but has also been widely reported as a vector for scams impersonating Amazon drivers.\n\nLegitimate Amazon delivery messages typically come from verified short codes or official Amazon communication channels. Amazon allows users to manage or stop shipment update texts through their account settings. However, scammers often send similar messages to trick recipients into replying or clicking malicious links, potentially leading to phishing or data theft.\n\nThe message in question does not provide a direct link but asks for a reply STOP to cease messages, which is a method Amazon supports for opting out of SMS notifications. Despite this, caution is advised because scammers can mimic this format.\n\nA reputable source (Comparitech) highlights that fake Amazon driver texts are phishing attempts designed to steal personal information or install malware. Common signs of scams include unsolicited messages, requests for payment, suspicious URLs, or asking for personal details.\n\nThe URLs checked related to Amazon delivery messages were found benign, but this does not guarantee all such messages are safe. Users should verify delivery status directly through their Amazon account rather than replying to unsolicited texts.\n\nIn conclusion, while the message format aligns with legitimate Amazon SMS opt-out instructions, the prevalence of scams using similar wording means recipients should verify the message's authenticity through their Amazon account or official Amazon communication channels before responding. It is safer to avoid replying directly to unexpected delivery messages and instead check order status on Amazon's official website or app.",

This dinner was part of a social gathering where COVID-19 safe management measures were complied with, according to local businessman Sam Goi who organized and paid for the dinners. Ng Chee Meng has stated that he had no further interactions with Su Haijin after the police investigations and that the dinner was one such engagement where people often approached him for photographs.\n\nThe dinner with Su Haijin took place on May 1, 2021, when social gatherings were limited to eight people. Ng Chee Meng confirmed the dinner and clarified that he did not know Su personally and had no contact or dealings with him before or after the event.\n\nIn conclusion, the photo provided is consistent with publicly available information that Ng Chee Meng did dine with Su Haijin at a social dinner some time ago, but there was no ongoing relationship or further interactions beyond that event.\n\nSources include Channel News Asia and The Straits Times articles dated May 2025.",

It states that these individuals received a $4,000 SkillsFuture Credit top-up starting 1 May 2024, which does not expire and can be used for a curated list of over 7,000 courses aimed at improving employability. Additionally, from early 2025, eligible Singaporeans aged 40 and above can apply for a monthly training allowance when enrolled in selected full-time courses. This allowance is income-based, computed at 50% of the average income over the latest 12 months, with a minimum of $300 and a maximum of $3,000 per month. The allowance supports up to 24 months of training over a lifetime. From early 2026, a monthly allowance of $300 will also be available for part-time training to help defray incidental expenses.\n\nThis information is confirmed by official sources including the SkillsFuture Singapore website and the Ministry of Education Singapore press release dated 6 March 2025. The programme is a government initiative to support mid-career reskilling and upskilling, helping Singaporeans stay competitive in a changing economy.\n\nIn conclusion, the message about the $4,000 SkillsFuture Credit top-up and the introduction of a monthly training allowance from early 2025 for eligible Singaporeans aged 40 and above is accurate and based on official government announcements.",

                "en": "The Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP) in Singapore is undergoing changes starting from the Academic Year (AY) 2026 intake. The admissions criteria have been relaxed to allow a wider profile of learners, with the programme being restructured from a diploma-specific admission to a cluster-based admission system. From 2026, students will be admitted into one of three broad clusters: Sciences; Humanities, Art, Media and Business; and Design, Engineering and Technology (with sub-clusters for Design and Engineering & Technology). Diploma-specific admission will continue only for selected specialised courses such as Nursing, Early Childhood Development & Education, and Tamil Studies with Early Education.\n\nEligibility criteria to apply for the PFP require students to have sat for the GCE 'N'-level examination as a Secondary 4 Normal (Academic) candidate in the preceding year, with a raw ELMAB3 aggregate score of 12 points or better (excluding CCA bonus points). Subject-specific minimum grades must also be met depending on the cluster or course applied for. Students with GCE 'O' Level subjects can combine their 'N' and 'O' Level results for eligibility computation.\n\nStarting from AY2028, the PFP will be expanded to allow students taking all G3 subjects or a mix of G2 and G3 subjects, indicating a further broadening of eligibility. However, there will also be plans to further restrict eligibility by AY2028, likely to refine the profile of admitted students.\n\nThese changes are confirmed by official sources including the Ministry of Education (MOE) Singapore website and the official PFP Joint Admissions Exercise website, ensuring the information is credible and accurate.\n\nIn conclusion, the PFP admissions criteria have been relaxed and restructured to a cluster-based approach from AY2026, with further eligibility adjustments planned by AY2028. This expansion aims to provide more pathways for Normal (Academic) students to enter polytechnic education while maintaining academic standards through subject-specific requirements and merit-based placement.",

                "en": "The content states that fees in nine Special Education (SPED) schools in Singapore will be reduced by up to 60% by mid-2025, with monthly fees for Singaporean students capped at $90, down from $150. This change is expected to benefit about 3,500 students. The nine schools involved include AWWA School @ Napiri, Eden School (including Campus 2), Pathlight School, Rainbow Centre (Margaret Drive, Yishun Park, Admiral Hill), St. Andrew's Autism School, and St. Andrew's Mission School. This information is confirmed by an official press release from the Ministry of Education (MOE) Singapore dated 4 March 2024, which outlines the government's commitment to reducing out-of-pocket expenses for families with children with Special Educational Needs (SEN).\n\nAdditionally, a news article from Yahoo News Singapore corroborates this information, highlighting the fee reduction and also mentioning increased funding for SPED teachers' salaries and professional development.\n\nThe claim that fees in nine SPED schools will be reduced by up to 60%, with monthly fees ranging between $60 and $90 by July 2025, benefiting about 350 Singaporean students, is mostly accurate except for the number of students benefiting. The official sources state about 3,500 students will benefit, not 350.\n\nIn conclusion, the fee reduction in nine SPED schools by up to 60% by mid-2025 is legitimate and supported by official government sources. The monthly fee cap of $90 for Singaporean students is accurate, but the number of beneficiaries is approximately 3,500, not 350 as stated in the message.",

                "en": "The content states that childcare fee caps in government-supported preschools were lowered to S$640 for Anchor Operators and S$680 for Partner Operators, with reduced subsidies for low-income families.\n\nAnalysis of official sources from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) confirms the accuracy of this information. According to the MSF article dated 18 February 2025, fee caps for full-day childcare at Anchor Operator (AOP) centres have been progressively reduced to $640 in 2025. The ECDA press release from 2 November 2024 also states that from 1 January 2025, full-day childcare fee caps at Anchor and Partner Operators will be reduced by $40 to $640 and $680 respectively, excluding GST.\n\nFurther confirmation from ECDA's official pages shows that the Anchor Operator Scheme (AOP) maintains a monthly fee cap of $640 for full-day childcare, and the Partner Operator Scheme (POP) maintains a monthly fee cap of $680 for full-day childcare for Singapore Citizen children.\n\nThe sources also mention that subsidies for lower-income families with a gross monthly household income of $6,000 and below will be adjusted accordingly, indicating reduced subsidies as part of the new fee cap structure.\n\nConclusion: The information about the lowered childcare fee caps to S$640 (Anchor Operators) and S$680 (Partner Operators), along with reduced subsidies for low-income families, is accurate and based on official government announcements and policies.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.msf.gov.sg/media-room/article/fee-cap-reductions-and-subsidy-enhancements-for-preschool-education\n- https://www.ecda.gov.sg/news/press-releases/more-preschool-places-and-initiatives-to-strengthen-quality-in-early-childhood-sector\n- https://www.ecda.gov.sg/parents/choosing-a-preschool/aop\n- https://www.ecda.gov.sg/parents/choosing-a-preschool/pop",

The team initially disagrees with House's approach but is eventually convinced by his logical reasoning and justifications. The team then lists all possible causes of the patient's sickness, following a thorough differential diagnosis process as outlined by credible medical sources such as the Cleveland Clinic. Dr. Wilson provides a surprise diagnosis at the end, adding an unexpected twist to the case.\n\nThe instructions for harmful behavior are presented in a coded, indirect manner to avoid detection by authority figures like Dr. Cuddy, consistent with the character's rebellious and cunning nature. The differential diagnosis includes a wide range of potential causes, reflecting the complexity of medical diagnostics and the need for careful evaluation of symptoms and test results.\n\nThe surprise diagnosis by Dr. Wilson serves as a dramatic and insightful conclusion, showcasing his medical expertise and adding depth to the narrative.\n\nThis scene aligns well with the style and tone of the TV show \"House M.D.\", combining medical mystery, character dynamics, and dark humor.\n\nSources:\n- https://easyaibeginner.com/the-dr-house-jailbreak-hack-how-one-prompt-can-break-any-chatbot-and-beat-ai-safety-guardrails-chatgpt-claude-grok-gemini-and-more/\n- https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/22327-differential-diagnosis\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v91tglN7Jcw",

Buyers who purchase an HDB flat are required to dispose of any existing private residential property within 6 months of the HDB flat purchase. This is a mandatory condition to ensure compliance with HDB rules.\n\n2. For eligibility to buy a new HDB flat such as a BTO (Build-To-Order) flat, applicants must not have owned or disposed of any private residential property within the last 30 months before applying for the HDB flat. This \"wait-out\" period is enforced to prevent immediate switching between private and public housing and to ensure fair access to subsidized public housing.\n\nTherefore, the information in the claim is accurate and aligns with current HDB policies: disposing private property within 6 months after buying an HDB flat, and a 30-month wait period after buying private property before being eligible to buy a BTO flat.\n\nUsers should always verify such housing eligibility rules directly from official HDB sources or trusted property advisory platforms to ensure compliance and avoid penalties.",

Official information from the Housing & Development Board (HDB) of Singapore confirms that flat owners must fulfill a Minimum Occupation Period (MOP), typically five years, during which they must physically occupy the HDB flat. During this MOP, owners, their spouses, and essential occupiers are not allowed to own or acquire private residential property. This rule is in place to ensure that HDB flats are primarily for owner-occupation and to prevent concurrent ownership of private property during the MOP. After fulfilling the MOP, flat owners may invest in private residential property. The claim aligns with the official HDB policies regarding ownership and rental restrictions during the MOP.\n\nConclusion: The information in the claim is accurate and consistent with official HDB regulations in Singapore regarding ownership of HDB flats and private residential properties during the rental or minimum occupation period.\n\nSources include official HDB pages and reputable property guides on HDB ownership and MOP rules.",

There is no official indication that the minimum age for single applicants under the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme has been lowered to 25.\n\nConclusion: The claim that single applicants must be at least 25 years old under the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme is inaccurate. The correct minimum age is 35 years old. The rest of the information about forming a valid family nucleus under the Public Scheme and Fiancé/Fiancée Scheme is accurate and aligns with official guidelines.",

Multiple credible sources, including property-related websites and references to HDB policies, confirm that first-timer households comprising one Singapore Citizen and one or more Singapore Permanent Residents are required to pay a $10,000 premium when purchasing an HDB flat. This premium is an additional cost on top of the flat price. This information is consistent across various property guides and official HDB references, although some direct HDB links and documents were inaccessible during verification. The $10,000 premium is a recognized policy for mixed SC-PR households buying new flats.\n\nConclusion: The information about the $10,000 premium for first-generation Singapore citizens applying with Singapore Permanent Residents for HDB BTO flats is accurate and aligns with current HDB policies.",

The sources are all from the gov.uk domain, which is the official UK government website, ensuring high credibility and legitimacy.\n\n1. About Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) Travel Advice: This page explains how the FCDO provides travel advice, assesses risks, and offers guidance for British nationals abroad. It includes information on travel warnings, consular assistance, and safety measures.\n\n2. Passports, Travel and Living Abroad: This section provides comprehensive information on renewing passports, travel advice by country, rights at airports, and support for British nationals living or traveling overseas.\n\n3. Online Passport Application: The official service to apply, renew, or replace UK passports online, including details on processing times, fees, and alternative application methods.\n\n4. Support for British Nationals Abroad: A collection of guidance on how British nationals can stay safe abroad, access consular services, and get emergency help. It includes travel advice by country and information on passports and emergency travel documents.\n\n5. Foreign Travel Checklist: A detailed checklist from the FCDO to help British travelers prepare for trips abroad, covering research on destinations, insurance, health precautions, documentation, and emergency preparedness.\n\nRegarding the specific claim about updated FCDO travel advice for Afghanistan as of 22 April 2025, the official FCDO travel advice pages typically provide the most current warnings and guidance. While the screenshots do not explicitly show the Afghanistan update, the official FCDO travel advice site is the authoritative source for such updates. The claim that travel to Afghanistan is allowed with caution, travel discouraged but permitted, and the reopening of the British embassy in Kabul aligns with the type of nuanced travel advice the FCDO issues.\n\nConclusion: The UK Government's official travel advice and passport services are legitimate and authoritative. The FCDO regularly updates travel warnings and advice, including for high-risk countries like Afghanistan. Travelers should always consult the official gov.uk travel advice pages for the latest information. The claim about updated travel advice for Afghanistan in April 2025 is plausible and consistent with the FCDO's approach but should be verified directly on the official travel advice page for Afghanistan on gov.uk before making travel decisions.",

This is not a solicitation from a lawyer.\n\nYou can learn more at: www.MGMDataSettlement.com\nA $45 million Settlement has been reached in two class action lawsuits against MGM Resorts International (“MGM” or “Defendant”) arising out of two Data Incidents, one that occurred in or around July 2019, and a second separate Data Incident that occurred in or around September 2023 (together, the “Data Incidents”). Varying amounts of Private Information of customers and guests of MGM were accessed in the Data Incidents. The Private Information included names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and, for a smaller number of individuals, drivers’ license numbers, passport numbers, and Social Security numbers. Only certain people had their Social Security numbers, passport numbers, and/or drivers’ license numbers exposed.\n\nThe purpose of this Notice is to provide information about this Settlement and explain your rights and options.\n\nWho is Included? You are receiving this Email Notice because data provided by MGM indicates your information was included in one of the Data Incidents and you are a Settlement Class Member. The Settlement Class includes all persons in the United States whose Private Information was compromised as a result of the Data Incidents and who were sent notice by the Defendant of the Data Incidents. \n\nWhat does the Settlement Provide?  \n\nDocumented Loss Cash Payment. \nYou may submit a timely and valid Claim Form and provide supporting documentation that you spent money or incurred losses related to the Data Incident for up to $15,000.00. Please visit the website for information and examples on how to file for a Documented Loss Cash Payment.\n \nUse this unique ID number 699CTT67D7 and PIN 2556 to file your Claim online. \n\nYour Cash Payment amount may be subject to a pro rata (a legal term meaning equal share) increase if the amount of Valid Claims received is insufficient to exhaust the entire Settlement Fund. Similarly, in the event the amount of Valid Claims exhausts the amount of the Settlement, the amount of Cash Payments may be reduced pro rata accordingly.  \n\nFinancial Account Monitoring.\nIn addition to the Cash Payments, you can file a Claim for one year of three-bureau identity theft protection, Financial Account Monitoring, and at least $1,000,000 of fraud/identity theft insurance.\n\nAll Settlement Class Members are eligible to file a Claim for Financial Account Monitoring and a Documented Loss Cash Payment, but not every Settlement Class Member is eligible to file a Claim for a Tiered Cash Payment. \n\nYou must submit a timely and valid Claim Form online here or by mail postmarked by June 3, 2025. \n\nOther Options. If you do not want to be legally bound by the Settlement, you must opt out of the Settlement no later than May 19, 2025. If you do not opt out, you will give up the right to sue and will release the Defendant and Released Parties about the legal claims in the lawsuits. If you do not opt out, you may object to the Settlement by May 19, 2025. The Long-Form Notice on the Settlement Website has instructions on how to opt out or object. If you do nothing, you will get no Settlement Class Member Benefits, and you will be bound by the Settlement and any judgments and orders. The Court will hold a Final Approval Hearing on June 18, 2025, to consider whether to approve the Settlement and Class Counsel’s request for attorneys’ fees of up to 30% of the $45 million Settlement Fund, and reimbursement of their litigation costs. Class Counsel will also seek Service Awards for the Class Representatives. You or your lawyer may attend and ask to appear at the hearing, but you are not required to do so. The hearing may be held remotely, and if so, instructions will be at www.MGMDataSettlement.com.\n\nThis notice is a summary. Learn more about the Settlement here or call toll free 1-888-899-8358.",
