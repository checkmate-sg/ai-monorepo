The message also warns that making silent calls to '999' is an offence and may lead to prosecution, as such calls impede the SPF from performing its duties and may put lives at risk.\n\nThe SMS number '70999' is confirmed as an official SMS text messaging platform by the Singapore Police Force for emergency assistance when it is unsafe to call '999' or when the caller cannot speak. This service is provided at no cost to users, though normal SMS rates apply.\n\nFurther verification from official SPF sources highlights that misuse of the emergency number '999', including silent or hoax calls, is taken seriously and is punishable under Singapore law. Such misuse causes delays in response to genuine emergencies and wastes police resources. The penalties for making harassing or obscene calls to emergency numbers can include imprisonment and fines.\n\nIn conclusion, the message is authentic and serves as an important reminder to avoid accidental or intentional silent calls to '999'. The use of SMS '70999' is a legitimate alternative for emergencies where speaking is not possible. Users should heed the advice to prevent unintended emergency calls and understand the legal consequences of misuse.",

This is a recognized policy to differentiate between households with only Singapore Citizens and those with PRs. This premium is documented in multiple official HDB annexes and property guides, which are legitimate and up-to-date sources.\n\nThe $10,000 premium applies specifically to couples or families where one party is a Singapore Citizen and the other is a PR. This is consistent across various official documents and property advisory sites.\n\nConclusion: The information about the $10,000 premium for first generation Singapore citizens applying with Singapore Permanent Residents for HDB BTO flats is accurate and legitimate, based on official HDB policies and credible property sources in Singapore.",

If it does this, it should cite the right source (https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/servicing-your-hdb-housing-loan/citizen-topup)",
