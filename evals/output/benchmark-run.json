The message also warns that making silent calls to '999' is an offence and may lead to prosecution, as such calls impede the SPF's duties and could put lives at risk.\n\nThe SMS number '70999' is confirmed as an official emergency SMS platform by the Singapore Police Force, intended for situations where it is unsafe to call '999' or when the caller cannot speak. This service is free to use, though normal SMS charges may apply. The information is supported by the official Singapore Police Force website (police.gov.sg) and other credible sources including government and news websites.\n\nThe failure to deliver an SMS to '70999' could be due to technical or registration issues with the sender's phone or network, but this does not affect the legitimacy of the number or the message content.\n\nIn conclusion, the message is authentic and serves as an important public safety notice from the Singapore Police Force.

However, official information from the Elections Department Singapore (ELD) and multiple credible sources confirms that the actual dates for the 2025 General Election are as follows:\n\n- Nomination Day: 23 April 2025\n- Election Campaign Period: From the end of Nomination Day until the day before Polling Day\n- Cooling-off Day: 2 May 2025 (the day before Polling Day)\n- Polling (Voting) Day: 3 May 2025\n\nThese dates are consistent across official ELD press releases, government websites, and reputable news outlets. The forwarded message's dates are incorrect and do not align with the official election schedule.\n\nThe logo and name of the Elections Department Singapore in the forwarded message appear authentic, but the content of the message is inaccurate and misleading regarding the election timeline.\n\nConclusion: The forwarded message contains incorrect information about the 2025 Singapore General Election dates.

                "en": "The content is an Instagram post claiming that Ng Chee Meng, a Singaporean labor chief, had a private dinner with Su Haijin, described as the leader of the Fujian Gang and a convicted money launderer. The post alleges that this meeting involved discussions about money laundering and criminal activities.\n\nCredible news sources such as Channel News Asia and The Straits Times have reported on the matter, confirming that Ng Chee Meng did meet Su Haijin during a private dinner. Su Haijin is indeed a convicted money launderer linked to the Fujian gang. However, official statements from Ng Chee Meng and other involved parties clarify that the meetings were part of public engagements or events, and there is no verified evidence that Ng Chee Meng was involved in any illegal activities or money laundering schemes. The reports also mention that some photos and claims circulating online have been misinterpreted or falsely attributed.\n\nThe Instagram post appears to mix factual elements (the meeting did occur) with unverified and speculative claims about criminal conspiracies without evidence. The source of the Instagram post is not a recognized or credible news outlet, and the narrative seems designed to provoke suspicion without substantiation.\n\nConclusion: While the meeting between Ng Chee Meng and Su Haijin is factual, the claims of criminal collaboration and money laundering in the Instagram post are unsubstantiated and misleading. The post should be treated with caution and not taken as proof of wrongdoing by Ng Chee Meng or others shown in the photo.\n\nSources include Channel News Asia and The Straits Times coverage on the incident.",

                "en": "The content claims that over 2,000 people in Singapore made appointments to get the flu vaccine following the death of Taiwanese actress Barbie Hsu. Barbie Hsu died from pneumonia caused by influenza while on holiday in Japan, as confirmed by multiple credible news sources including BBC, CNN, and The Straits Times. This tragic event reportedly led to a surge in demand for flu vaccinations in Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.\n\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) in Singapore and various clinics observed a significant increase in flu vaccine appointments and inquiries shortly after the news of Barbie Hsu's death became public. MOH has assured the public that there is sufficient stock of influenza vaccines in Singapore to meet the increased demand.\n\nThe original source cited in the content, Mothership.sg, is a known local news and lifestyle website, though the user was blocked from accessing the specific article. However, the information is corroborated by other reputable sources such as The Straits Times, which confirms the surge in flu vaccine demand and MOH's assurance of adequate vaccine supply.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that over 2,000 people in Singapore made flu vaccine appointments after Barbie Hsu's death is accurate and supported by credible news reports and official statements from MOH. The event has indeed caused heightened public awareness and increased flu vaccination uptake in the region.",

The CSA cautions voters about phishing, scams, misinformation, and disinformation that may be encountered during the election period. It highlights threats such as phishing attacks impersonating trustworthy entities, fraudulent emails, text messages, and phone calls impersonating election candidates or political parties, as well as malicious actors spreading false or misleading information to manipulate voter behavior.\n\nThe article also discusses malware risks where voters' devices could be compromised by downloading malware disguised as legitimate software, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access. The CSA advises vigilance against manipulation and misinformation, which can distort public perception and harm the credibility of candidates or parties.\n\nTo stay safe, the CSA recommends good cyber hygiene practices, such as being wary of unsolicited emails and messages, verifying the source of information, and only trusting official election websites and verified media accounts. The CSA also notes that the Elections Department does not send WhatsApp or Telegram messages with clickable links and cautions against scam links impersonating official sources.\n\nThis information is consistent with official advisories from the CSA and is aimed at protecting voters from cyber threats during the election period. The source, Channel News Asia, is a reputable news outlet in Singapore, and the CSA is the official government agency responsible for cybersecurity.\n\nConclusion: The content is credible and provides important, factual information about cybersecurity risks and preventive measures during the 2025 General Election in Singapore. Voters should heed these warnings and follow recommended safety practices to avoid falling victim to scams and misinformation.",

The accompanying Instagram post urges people not to just pray for Myanmar but to learn about the military coup and the resulting chaos and atrocities.\n\nCredible news sources such as BBC, The Guardian, and National Geographic confirm that Myanmar has been experiencing severe turmoil since the military coup in 2021. The country is in the grip of a civil war, with ongoing violence and destruction. Recent events include a major earthquake in March 2025 that caused widespread damage, including the collapse of historic and religious sites such as temples and pagodas. This natural disaster compounded the difficulties faced by the population amid the military junta's oppressive rule.\n\nThe collapsed temple in the image is consistent with reports of earthquake damage rather than direct destruction caused by military action. However, the broader context of the military coup and civil war has led to significant suffering and atrocities against the people of Myanmar.\n\nIn conclusion, the image is likely depicting earthquake damage to a temple in Myanmar, which is part of the larger crisis involving the military coup and civil war. The call to action in the post to learn about the situation and support Myanmar's people is valid and grounded in the ongoing humanitarian crisis.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/c22ylwnm5zgt\n- https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/05/myanmar-earthquake-rebuild-junta-civil-war\n- https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/myanmar-earthquake-religious-cultural-sites",

The SMRT website's train service updates page is currently clear of any disruption notices. The sgtrains.com site, although temporarily inaccessible for detailed status, is generally a reliable source and shows normal service for the Circle Line. Recent news and social media updates from SMRT and LTA also do not report any Circle Line breakdown today. Scheduled service adjustments for the Circle Line relate to early closures and later openings on certain weekends but not breakdowns. The official SMRT social media accounts, which provide real-time updates, do not show any alerts or announcements about a breakdown on the Circle Line today. \n\nConclusion: There is no credible evidence of a Circle Line train breakdown at this time. The claim appears to be false or outdated. Commuters should rely on official SMRT channels and government sources for accurate and timely train service information.",

It urges the public to call 999 immediately if seen and warns not to approach him.\n\nA search for credible information about this individual and related police notices shows no official or news reports corroborating this wanted notice. Instead, the search results predominantly reference a different individual named Charles Yeo, a lawyer and former political figure wanted by police for breaching court conditions related to travel, with no mention of armed robbery or the details in the image.\n\nThe official Singapore Police Force website was checked and found to be benign, but no matching wanted notice or alert was found there.\n\nGiven the lack of verification from official police sources or reputable news outlets, and the discrepancy in the name and details compared to known wanted persons, this image appears to be a fabricated or misleading wanted notice. It is advised not to share or act on this image without confirmation from official police channels.\n\nConclusion: The wanted notice in the image is not verified and likely false. For safety and accuracy, always refer to official Singapore Police Force communications for wanted persons alerts.",

Bananas are widely recognized as a good source of potassium, vitamin B6, vitamin C, and fiber. Medical sources such as Healthline and Medical News Today confirm that bananas are often recommended to address potassium deficiency. Potassium deficiency symptoms include muscle weakness, cramps, fatigue, irregular heartbeats, and digestive issues. Eating bananas can help replenish potassium levels and alleviate these symptoms. The URLs checked for this information are from reputable health websites and are classified as benign, indicating they are safe and credible sources.\n\nIn conclusion, if a doctor advises eating more bananas, it is likely due to a potassium deficiency or a need to increase potassium intake for muscle and heart health.

There is no credible or official source confirming this promotion. The number 6591607962 does not appear in any trusted government or company communications, and no legitimate marketing or promotional campaigns are linked to it. Attempts to verify the number and promotion through searches and social media checks yielded no valid results. The Facebook link provided for a warning about scams was inaccessible due to a temporary block.\n\nGiven the lack of verification and the nature of the message, it is highly likely to be a scam or phishing attempt. Users should avoid responding to or engaging with such messages, especially those asking to send SMS codes to unknown numbers. It is advisable to only trust promotions from official company or government channels and to be cautious of unsolicited offers that require immediate action or personal information.\n\nConclusion: The SMS message offering a free fruit stick redemption via sending a code to 6591607962 is not verified and is likely a scam. It is recommended to disregard and delete such messages to avoid potential fraud or data compromise.",

Similarly, unsolicited TikTok verification codes can be a sign of phishing or account takeover attempts, especially if the recipient did not request them.\n\nThe URL check for gcash.com returned a benign result, confirming the official site is safe, but scammers often spoof legitimate brands in SMS messages.\n\nConclusion: The messages are consistent with known scam tactics involving OTP phishing and unsolicited verification codes. Users should never share OTPs or verification codes received unexpectedly and should verify any such messages directly through official apps or websites. The sender labeled \"Likely-SCAM\" is appropriately flagged, and the content should be treated as suspicious and potentially harmful if acted upon.",

The website critical.sg is associated with the blogger Michael Petraeus, also known as Critical Spectator, who is known for his controversial and critical views on Singaporean politics. \n\nThe website critical.sg is not an official government or mainstream news source but rather an independent blog with a reputation for provocative and sometimes polarizing commentary. It is generally considered a platform for opinion and critique rather than objective news reporting. The article itself is opinion-based and reflects the author's perspective on political communication and governance in Singapore.\n\nThe URL is benign and not malicious. However, the content should be read with an understanding that it represents the views of an individual commentator rather than an official or widely recognized authority. \n\nIn conclusion, the article is a legitimate opinion piece from a known independent political commentator but should not be taken as an official or factual government communication. Readers should consider the context and potential bias when interpreting the content.",

However, the linked pages themselves appear to be blank or non-functional, which is suspicious.\n\nSingtel's official scam advisory warns customers about impersonation scams, including those falsely claiming to be related to National Day Parade (NDP) giveaways or other promotions. There have been multiple reports and advisories about scams impersonating Singtel, often involving fake giveaways or rewards to lure victims into clicking links or providing personal information.\n\nThe messages use typical scam tactics such as urgency, free high-value gifts, and a call to action with a link. The presence of a legitimate Singtel subdomain does not guarantee the messages are authentic, as scammers can sometimes exploit legitimate domains or create convincing URLs.\n\nConclusion: The SMS messages are very likely part of a scam impersonating Singtel Mo4U promotions. Recipients should not click on the links or provide any personal information. It is advisable to verify any such promotions directly through official Singtel channels or their verified website. Singtel's official scam advisory page provides guidance on recognizing and avoiding such scams.",

These scams often involve offers of prizes or exclusive gifts to lure recipients into providing personal details or clicking suspicious links. Official CapitaLand and CapitaStar channels have issued warnings about such scams.\n\nThe URL in the email was checked and found to be benign but with a moderate suspicion score, which suggests caution.

                "en": "The content describes a $45 million settlement related to two data breaches involving MGM Resorts International, one in July 2019 and another in September 2023. The breaches exposed private information including names, addresses, contact details, dates of birth, and for some, sensitive identifiers like driver's license numbers, passport numbers, and Social Security numbers. The settlement offers benefits such as documented loss cash payments up to $15,000, identity theft protection, financial account monitoring, and fraud insurance. Claim submission deadlines and opt-out dates are provided.\n\nSearches confirm the legitimacy of the settlement, with multiple reputable sources reporting on the $45 million class action settlement against MGM Resorts International for these data incidents. The official settlement website is mgmdatasettlement.com, which matches the domain in the message. However, attempts to access the website and its FAQ page resulted in access blocks, likely due to regional restrictions or security measures. The URL was scanned and found to be benign, not malicious.\n\nThe settlement details, including the amounts, dates, and types of compensation, align with credible news and legal sources. The official toll-free number 1-888-899-8358 and email info@MGMDataSettlement.com are consistent with those listed in official notices.\n\nConclusion: The message about the MGM Resorts data breach settlement is legitimate and accurate based on multiple independent and credible sources. The website domain is genuine but may have access restrictions depending on location. Recipients of such notices should verify their eligibility and consider filing claims before the stated deadlines, while being cautious to use official contact details only.",

This is not a solicitation from a lawyer.\n\nYou can learn more at: www.MGMDataSettlement.com\nA $45 million Settlement has been reached in two class action lawsuits against MGM Resorts International (“MGM” or “Defendant”) arising out of two Data Incidents, one that occurred in or around July 2019, and a second separate Data Incident that occurred in or around September 2023 (together, the “Data Incidents”). Varying amounts of Private Information of customers and guests of MGM were accessed in the Data Incidents. The Private Information included names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and, for a smaller number of individuals, drivers’ license numbers, passport numbers, and Social Security numbers. Only certain people had their Social Security numbers, passport numbers, and/or drivers’ license numbers exposed.\n\nThe purpose of this Notice is to provide information about this Settlement and explain your rights and options.\n\nWho is Included? You are receiving this Email Notice because data provided by MGM indicates your information was included in one of the Data Incidents and you are a Settlement Class Member. The Settlement Class includes all persons in the United States whose Private Information was compromised as a result of the Data Incidents and who were sent notice by the Defendant of the Data Incidents. \n\nWhat does the Settlement Provide?  \n\nDocumented Loss Cash Payment. \nYou may submit a timely and valid Claim Form and provide supporting documentation that you spent money or incurred losses related to the Data Incident for up to $15,000.00. Please visit the website for information and examples on how to file for a Documented Loss Cash Payment.\n \nUse this unique ID number 699CTT67D7 and PIN 2556 to file your Claim online. \n\nYour Cash Payment amount may be subject to a pro rata (a legal term meaning equal share) increase if the amount of Valid Claims received is insufficient to exhaust the entire Settlement Fund. Similarly, in the event the amount of Valid Claims exhausts the amount of the Settlement, the amount of Cash Payments may be reduced pro rata accordingly.  \n\nFinancial Account Monitoring.\nIn addition to the Cash Payments, you can file a Claim for one year of three-bureau identity theft protection, Financial Account Monitoring, and at least $1,000,000 of fraud/identity theft insurance.\n\nAll Settlement Class Members are eligible to file a Claim for Financial Account Monitoring and a Documented Loss Cash Payment, but not every Settlement Class Member is eligible to file a Claim for a Tiered Cash Payment. \n\nYou must submit a timely and valid Claim Form online here or by mail postmarked by June 3, 2025. \n\nOther Options. If you do not want to be legally bound by the Settlement, you must opt out of the Settlement no later than May 19, 2025. If you do not opt out, you will give up the right to sue and will release the Defendant and Released Parties about the legal claims in the lawsuits. If you do not opt out, you may object to the Settlement by May 19, 2025. The Long-Form Notice on the Settlement Website has instructions on how to opt out or object. If you do nothing, you will get no Settlement Class Member Benefits, and you will be bound by the Settlement and any judgments and orders. The Court will hold a Final Approval Hearing on June 18, 2025, to consider whether to approve the Settlement and Class Counsel’s request for attorneys’ fees of up to 30% of the $45 million Settlement Fund, and reimbursement of their litigation costs. Class Counsel will also seek Service Awards for the Class Representatives. You or your lawyer may attend and ask to appear at the hearing, but you are not required to do so. The hearing may be held remotely, and if so, instructions will be at www.MGMDataSettlement.com.\n\nThis notice is a summary. Learn more about the Settlement here or call toll free 1-888-899-8358.",

Varying amounts of Private Information of customers and guests of MGM were accessed in the Data Incidents. The Private Information included names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and, for a smaller number of individuals, drivers’ license numbers, passport numbers, and Social Security numbers. Only certain people had their Social Security numbers, passport numbers, and/or drivers’ license numbers exposed.\n\nThe purpose of this Notice is to provide information about this Settlement and explain your rights and options.\n\nWho is Included? You are receiving this Email Notice because data provided by MGM indicates your information was included in one of the Data Incidents and you are a Settlement Class Member. The Settlement Class includes all persons in the United States whose Private Information was compromised as a result of the Data Incidents and who were sent notice by the Defendant of the Data Incidents. \n\nWhat does the Settlement Provide?  \n\nDocumented Loss Cash Payment. \nYou may submit a timely and valid Claim Form and provide supporting documentation that you spent money or incurred losses related to the Data Incident for up to $15,000.00. Please visit the website for information and examples on how to file for a Documented Loss Cash Payment.\n \nUse this unique ID number 699CTT67D7 and PIN 2556 to file your Claim online. \n\nYour Cash Payment amount may be subject to a pro rata (a legal term meaning equal share) increase if the amount of Valid Claims received is insufficient to exhaust the entire Settlement Fund. Similarly, in the event the amount of Valid Claims exhausts the amount of the Settlement, the amount of Cash Payments may be reduced pro rata accordingly.  \n\nFinancial Account Monitoring.\nIn addition to the Cash Payments, you can file a Claim for one year of three-bureau identity theft protection, Financial Account Monitoring, and at least $1,000,000 of fraud/identity theft insurance.\n\nAll Settlement Class Members are eligible to file a Claim for Financial Account Monitoring and a Documented Loss Cash Payment, but not every Settlement Class Member is eligible to file a Claim for a Tiered Cash Payment. \n\nYou must submit a timely and valid Claim Form online here or by mail postmarked by June 3, 2025. \n\nOther Options. If you do not want to be legally bound by the Settlement, you must opt out of the Settlement no later than May 19, 2025. If you do not opt out, you will give up the right to sue and will release the Defendant and Released Parties about the legal claims in the lawsuits. If you do not opt out, you may object to the Settlement by May 19, 2025. The Long-Form Notice on the Settlement Website has instructions on how to opt out or object. If you do nothing, you will get no Settlement Class Member Benefits, and you will be bound by the Settlement and any judgments and orders. The Court will hold a Final Approval Hearing on June 18, 2025, to consider whether to approve the Settlement and Class Counsel’s request for attorneys’ fees of up to 30% of the $45 million Settlement Fund, and reimbursement of their litigation costs. Class Counsel will also seek Service Awards for the Class Representatives. You or your lawyer may attend and ask to appear at the hearing, but you are not required to do so.

The company claims to specialize in upgrades and equipment for battle tanks and military vehicles, targeting government buyers. The website itself appears outdated and cluttered with numerous images and technical diagrams, which may affect its professional appearance but does not necessarily indicate illegitimacy.\n\nThe domain was checked and found to be benign with a very low risk score. Multiple business directories and company registration databases confirm the existence and registration status of European Armour Union Pte Ltd in Singapore. There are no credible reports or reviews indicating that the company or website is a scam. However, the niche nature of the business and limited public information suggest it is a specialized defense contractor rather than a consumer-facing company.\n\nIn conclusion, euroau.com is a legitimate website representing a registered Singapore company involved in defense-related products and services. While the website design is not modern or polished, the company is officially registered and the domain is safe. Caution is advised when dealing with specialized defense suppliers, and direct contact with the company for verification is recommended if engaging in business.\n",

                "en": "The content concerns Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's justification of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) increase, which has sparked public debate. Lawrence Wong has defended the GST hike as a necessary measure to close the fiscal gap and sustain public spending until 2030. He has also stated that the GST increase did not significantly accelerate inflation and that no further GST hikes are expected up to 2030. However, netizens have expressed strong opposition, arguing that the GST increase has raised living costs and business expenses, exacerbating economic burdens on citizens. Some netizens believe the GST hike could have been delayed given the already high prices and economic challenges faced by Singaporeans. The discussion reflects a broader concern about the cost of living in Singapore and the government's fiscal policies.\n\nThe sources include credible news outlets such as The Straits Times, Channel News Asia, and The Business Times, alongside public opinion platforms and social media commentary. The information about Lawrence Wong's stance is consistent across official and reputable media, while the netizens' views represent public sentiment and criticism.\n\nIn conclusion, the GST increase is a government policy defended by Lawrence Wong as fiscally necessary, but it remains controversial among the public due to its impact on living costs. The debate highlights the tension between fiscal responsibility and economic relief for citizens. Users should consider both official statements and public concerns when evaluating the GST increase issue.",

Official Meta communications warn users not to click on suspicious links or respond to such emails.\n\nThe domain \"support.fa...\" is incomplete and does not correspond to any known legitimate Meta domain. Attempts to verify the domain as safe were inconclusive due to the incomplete domain, but similar scams have been reported with fake Meta support emails.\n\nConclusion: The contact shown is very likely part of a phishing or scam attempt impersonating Meta Payments Support.

Reliable sources warn that survey scams often use tactics like promising rewards to lure victims into providing sensitive data or paying hidden fees.

Multiple credible news sources such as The Straits Times, Channel News Asia, and AsiaOne have reported on such queues in the past, confirming that the concept of people queuing at ATMs in Singapore is plausible and has been documented.\n\nHowever, the website linked in the advertisement (skylineup.top) is flagged as suspicious with a high risk score (0.81), indicating potential malicious or scam activity. This suggests that the advertisement is likely not a legitimate or safe financial trading platform and should be approached with caution.\n\nIn conclusion, while the news claim about people queuing at ATMs is consistent with known events in Singapore, the associated advertisement promoting trading on the linked site is suspicious and potentially unsafe. Users should be wary of engaging with the advertised site or offers.\n\nSources include The Straits Times, Channel News Asia, AsiaOne, and online URL safety checkers.",

According to the article, Jack Ma was reportedly pressured to assist in the prosecution of an out-of-favour Chinese official by intimidating a businessman. This campaign was part of a broader effort by Chinese authorities to enforce political purges and maintain control.\n\nThe article details how Jack Ma was allegedly coerced into pressuring a friend, a China-born Singapore citizen, to return to China to aid in the prosecution of a former deputy public security minister. The report highlights the use of psychological and legal intimidation tactics by the Chinese government, including threats of extradition and imprisonment.\n\nThe information is corroborated by multiple credible sources, including investigative journalism projects and international news outlets, confirming the legitimacy of the claims. The URL provided (malaysia.yahoo.com) is benign and appears to be a legitimate news aggregator site, but the original detailed report is from The Guardian, a well-known and reliable news organization.\n\nIn conclusion, the content about Jack Ma's involvement in an intimidation campaign by the Chinese regime is credible and based on verified investigative journalism. It reflects ongoing political dynamics within China and the use of influential figures in state-led campaigns. Readers should consider the context of political pressure and human rights concerns when interpreting this information.",

This type of message is commonly used in Amazon delivery notifications but is also frequently mimicked in scams.\n\nResearch shows that Amazon does send legitimate delivery updates via text, and users can reply STOP to opt out of these notifications. However, scammers often send fake Amazon driver texts to trick recipients into clicking malicious links or providing personal information.\n\nLegitimate Amazon texts typically do not ask for payment or personal details and do not contain suspicious URLs. The message in question does not provide a link but simply instructs to reply STOP, which aligns with Amazon's official opt-out method.\n\nA reputable source (Comparitech) advises caution with Amazon driver texts, recommending verifying messages by logging into the official Amazon account and checking order status directly rather than interacting with unsolicited messages.\n\nConclusion: The message appears to be a legitimate Amazon delivery notification based on its format and content. However, users should always verify by checking their Amazon account directly and avoid clicking on any suspicious links or providing personal information. Replying STOP to Amazon's official SMS number is a valid way to stop notifications.\n\nSources include Amazon's official help pages and a detailed guide on spotting fake Amazon driver texts from Comparitech.",

Their official website (https://www.cmcmarkets.com/en-sg/) is verified as benign and provides online trading services for various financial instruments.\n\nThe DBS hotline for reporting unauthorized transactions is consistent with official DBS contact information, which includes a 24-hour fraud reporting number: 1800 339 6963 or (65) 6339 6963 from overseas.\n\nGiven the legitimacy of CMC Markets Singapore and the DBS contact details, the message appears to be a genuine transaction notification from DBS. However, recipients should always verify such messages directly with their bank if unsure.\n\nConclusion: The transaction notification is credible and likely legitimate, but users should remain vigilant and contact DBS immediately if the transaction was not authorized to prevent potential fraud.",

Multiple credible news sources from May 2025 confirm that Ng Chee Meng, a prominent Singaporean labor leader and former minister, did dine with Su Haijin, a convicted money launderer linked to a major Singapore money laundering case. The photo has circulated widely and was posted online by various parties, including former Reform Party chairman Charles Yeo. Ng Chee Meng has publicly acknowledged the dinner took place some time ago and stated he had no further interactions with Su Haijin after police investigations. The dinner photo has sparked public concern due to Su Haijin's criminal background, and Ng Chee Meng has addressed the issue in media statements, even requesting not to be assigned a government position following the controversy.\n\nIn conclusion, the photo is genuine evidence that Ng Chee Meng did dine with Su Haijin, although the meeting was reportedly limited and occurred some time back. The incident has been covered extensively by reputable news outlets and has been officially acknowledged by Ng Chee Meng himself.\n\nSources include Channel News Asia, The Straits Times, Reuters, and Mothership.sg.",

This policy change aims to allow more students proficient in their MTL to take HMTL as a subject in secondary school, recognizing their strengths and interests.\n\nThis information is confirmed by official sources including the Ministry of Education (MOE) Singapore press release dated 14 September 2024, which explicitly states that from 2026, students who do well in their MTL at PSLE can offer HMTL at Secondary 1 regardless of their overall PSLE score. The press release also clarifies that previously, eligibility was tied to students' overall PSLE score to ensure they could cope with the curriculum. The new policy will better support students' bilingualism and language proficiency.\n\nAdditional credible news coverage from Channel News Asia corroborates this, reporting that students who obtain AL1/AL2 in MTL or a distinction/merit in HMTL at PSLE will be able to take HMTL in secondary school from 2026, regardless of their overall PSLE score.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim is accurate and reflects an official policy update by the Singapore Ministry of Education to expand access to Higher Mother Tongue Language studies in secondary schools starting 2026, based on students' MTL performance at PSLE rather than overall PSLE results. This initiative supports bilingualism and recognizes students' language strengths.",

This allowance is based on 50% of the individual's average monthly income, capped at $3,000 per month. The programme also offers up to 90% subsidy on course fees, personalised consultations, flexible learning options, and career transition support.\n\nThese details are confirmed by official SkillsFuture sources, including the MySkillsFuture website and Ministry of Education press releases. The information is accurate and legitimate, reflecting government initiatives to support mid-career Singaporeans in their professional development.\n\nIn conclusion, the message about the $4,000 SkillsFuture Credit top-up and the monthly training allowance starting in 2025 is credible and aligns with official government programmes aimed at mid-career reskilling and training support.",

The PFP will transition from diploma-specific admissions to a cluster-based admission system, grouping courses into three broad clusters: Sciences; Humanities, Art, Media and Business; and Design, Engineering and Technology (with sub-clusters for Design and Engineering & Technology at NYP and TP). Diploma-specific admissions will continue only for selected specialized courses such as Nursing, Early Childhood Development & Education, and Tamil Studies with Early Education.\n\nEligibility criteria require students to have sat for the GCE 'N'-Level examination as Secondary 4 N(A) candidates in the preceding year, with a raw ELMAB3 aggregate score of 12 points or better (excluding CCA bonus points). Subject-specific minimum grade requirements apply depending on the cluster. Students may also combine 'N' and 'O' Level results for eligibility computation. Additional requirements such as interviews, tests, or grade thresholds apply for certain courses.\n\nThe eligibility criteria have been relaxed to allow a wider profile of learners, with the cluster-based approach aimed at providing more flexible pathways. Further restrictions on eligibility are planned for AY2028, as indicated by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and polytechnic official sources.\n\nThis information is confirmed by official sources including the Ministry of Education Singapore website, the PFP Joint Admissions Exercise site, and polytechnic websites such as Nanyang Polytechnic.\n\nIn conclusion, the message about the expansion and restructuring of the PFP admissions criteria and cluster-based approach from AY2026, with further eligibility restrictions planned by AY2028, is accurate and based on official government and polytechnic information.",

Specifically, students who achieve AL1 or AL2 in MTL or obtain a Distinction/Merit in HMTL at PSLE can take HMTL as a subject in secondary school. This policy change aims to recognize and develop students' strengths and interests in their mother tongue languages and to support bilingualism.\n\nThe official MOE press release dated 14 September 2024 confirms these details and highlights additional initiatives such as a new structured MTL reading program in primary schools and increased MTL exposure in kindergartens. Channel News Asia also reports on this policy change, quoting Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing and emphasizing the government's commitment to bilingualism and supporting students' language learning.\n\nIn conclusion, the information about expanded access to Higher Mother Tongue Language from 2026 is accurate and comes from credible, official government sources.

This change is expected to benefit about 3,500 students, not 350, indicating a likely typographical error in the original claim. The nine SPED schools involved include AWWA School @ Napiri, Eden School (including Campus 2), Pathlight School, Rainbow Centre (Margaret Drive, Yishun Park, Admiral Hill), St. Andrew's Autism School, and St. Andrew's Mission School.\n\nThis information is confirmed by an official press release from the Ministry of Education (MOE) Singapore dated 4 March 2024, which outlines the government's commitment to reducing out-of-pocket expenses for families with children with Special Educational Needs (SEN). The MOE also highlights efforts to enhance the quality of SPED education through professional development for teachers.\n\nA news article from Yahoo News Singapore corroborates the fee reduction and adds that the MOE will increase salaries for trained SPED teachers and teacher aides, further supporting the sector.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim about the fee reduction in nine SPED schools by up to 60% with monthly fees ranging between $60 and $90 by mid-2025 is accurate and supported by credible government and news sources. The number of beneficiaries is approximately 3,500 Singaporean students, not 350 as initially stated.",

This is part of ongoing efforts to make preschool education more affordable and accessible.\n\nAdditionally, subsidies for lower-income families with a gross monthly household income of $6,000 and below will be adjusted accordingly to reflect the new fee caps. The government is also rolling out a new digital preschool subsidy application process via LifeSG from December 2024.\n\nThese changes are part of broader initiatives announced in late 2024 and early 2025 to increase preschool places, enhance subsidy schemes, and improve the quality of early childhood education in Singapore.\n\nConclusion: The information about the lowering of childcare fee caps to S$640 for anchor operators and S$680 for partner operators, along with reduced subsidies for low-income families, is accurate and based on official government sources. This reflects genuine policy updates aimed at improving affordability and accessibility of preschool education in Singapore.",

Eligibility criteria include being a Singapore Citizen aged 21 and above, having an average gross monthly income of S$5,000 or less in the past 12 months, prior employment in Singapore for at least six months, and residing in a property with an annual value of S$31,000 or less.\n\nApplicants must participate in supported job search activities to earn points and qualify for monthly payouts. The scheme aims to support retrenched workers in finding jobs that better utilize their skills and experiences.\n\nThe information is sourced from official Singapore government websites, ensuring its credibility and legitimacy. The scheme is not a loan but a support payout based on participation and eligibility.\n\nConclusion: The message about a Temporary Financial Support Scheme for retrenched or involuntarily unemployed workers is accurate and refers to the SkillsFuture Jobseeker Support scheme, a legitimate government initiative in Singapore.",

Buyers who purchase an HDB flat are required to dispose of any existing private residential property within 6 months from the legal completion of the HDB flat purchase. This is a well-established rule to prevent ownership of both private and HDB properties simultaneously.\n\n2. For eligibility to buy a BTO (Build-To-Order) flat, there is a \"wait-out\" period of 30 months after disposing of a private residential property before one can apply for a BTO flat. This means if a person has bought a private property within the last 30 months, they are generally not eligible to buy a BTO flat.\n\nThese rules are part of HDB's measures to ensure fair access to public housing and to regulate ownership of private and public housing.\n\nConclusion: The information in the claim is accurate and aligns with official HDB policies and eligibility criteria for purchasing HDB flats and BTO flats in Singapore.\n\nSources include official HDB pages and trusted property advisory websites.",

However, multiple credible secondary sources such as PropertyGuru, a well-known Singapore property portal, confirm the following:\n\n1. HDB flat owners are generally restricted to owning only one HDB flat at a time.\n2. During the Minimum Occupation Period (MOP) of an HDB flat (usually 5 years), owners are not allowed to own private residential property concurrently.\n3. After fulfilling the MOP, HDB flat owners may purchase private residential property.\n4. If an individual owns a private property, they must dispose of it before buying an HDB flat, or wait until the MOP is completed if they already own an HDB flat.\n\nThese rules are in place to ensure fair access to public housing and to prevent dual ownership of subsidized and private housing during the restricted period.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement is largely accurate in the context of Singapore's housing regulations: flat owners cannot own both an HDB flat and a private residential property during the rental or Minimum Occupation Period. They are also restricted to owning only one HDB flat at any time. This aligns with official housing policies aimed at ensuring equitable housing distribution.\n\nUsers should always verify such information through official HDB channels or trusted property advisory sources for the most current and detailed rules.",

Public Scheme and Fiancé/Fiancée Scheme require applicants to form a valid family nucleus, typically involving at least one Singapore Citizen and other family members or fiancé/fiancée.\n\n2. The Single Singapore Citizen Scheme is specifically for single Singapore Citizens applying alone. However, the minimum age requirement for this scheme is 35 years old, not 25 years old as stated in the content.\n\n3. The age requirement of 35 years for singles is consistent across official HDB resources and trusted property advisory platforms.\n\nConclusion: The information about forming a valid family nucleus and applying under the mentioned schemes is accurate. However, the stated minimum age of 25 years for single applicants under the Single Singapore Citizen Scheme is incorrect. The correct minimum age is 35 years old.\n\nUsers should rely on official HDB sources or trusted property advisory websites for the most accurate and updated eligibility criteria when applying under these schemes in Singapore.",

                "en": "The claim states that first generation Singapore citizens applying for HDB BTO flats with Singapore Permanent Residents (PRs) need to pay a $10,000 premium. This is accurate. Reliable sources including property-related websites and government-related portals confirm that first-timer households comprising one Singapore Citizen and one or more PRs must pay a $10,000 premium at the point of flat purchase. However, this premium can be reimbursed through the Citizen Top-Up Grant of $10,000 when the PR family member obtains Singapore citizenship or when the household has a Singapore Citizen child. This means the premium is initially payable but can be offset later under qualifying conditions.\n\nThe information is consistent across multiple credible sources, including propertyguru.com.sg and other housing advisory sites. Official HDB pages related to flat eligibility and grants also mention the Citizen Top-Up Grant as a housing subsidy for such households.\n\nIn conclusion, the message about the $10,000 premium for first generation Singapore citizens applying with PRs for HDB BTO flats is true, with the important context that the premium can be refunded via the Citizen Top-Up Grant upon citizenship conversion or having a citizen child in the household.",

                "en": "The content reviewed consists of official UK Government webpages from the gov.uk domain, covering various topics related to travel advice, passports, support for British nationals abroad, and travel checklists. These pages are maintained by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) and provide authoritative and up-to-date information for British nationals.\n\n1. About Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office Travel Advice: This page explains the role of the FCDO in providing travel advice, including safety, health, and legal considerations for travelers.\n\n2. Passports, Travel and Living Abroad: This page offers comprehensive guidance on renewing passports, travel advice by country, and living abroad, including rights and support.\n\n3. Apply Online for a UK Passport: This service page allows British nationals to apply for, renew, or replace passports online, with clear instructions and related resources.\n\n4. Support for British Nationals Abroad: This collection provides guidance on how British nationals can get help abroad, including emergency assistance, travel advice by country, and consular services.\n\n5. Foreign Travel Checklist: A detailed checklist from the FCDO to help British travelers prepare for trips abroad, covering research, insurance, documents, health, and emergency planning.\n\nRegarding the specific claim about updated FCDO travel advice for Afghanistan as of 22 April 2025, the official FCDO travel advice pages typically include country-specific updates and warnings. While the screenshots do not explicitly show the Afghanistan travel advisory, the FCDO regularly updates travel advice and warnings, including cautionary advice for high-risk countries. The reopening of the British embassy in Kabul and the advisory to travel with caution, while discouraging travel, aligns with the type of nuanced guidance the FCDO provides.\n\nConclusion: The information from the official UK Government sources is credible and authoritative. The FCDO does update travel advice regularly, including for countries like Afghanistan. The claim that travel to Afghanistan is allowed with caution, with the reopening of the British embassy in Kabul, is consistent with the nature of FCDO advisories. Users should always refer directly to the official gov.uk travel advice pages for the most current and detailed information before traveling.\n\nNo evidence was found to contradict the claim, and the official sources confirm the legitimacy of the travel advice framework described.",

It provides official MOM website links for making appointments and for work permit transactions related to domestic helpers and confinement nannies. It also includes a hotline number for assistance and a reference number, and states it is an automated message from the Singapore Government.\n\nVerification of the URLs shows that all links are benign and belong to the official MOM domain (mom.gov.sg). Screenshots of the official MOM website and the specific pages for making appointments and work permit transactions confirm the presence of related information and services consistent with the message content. The MOM website also prominently warns that MOM officers will never ask for money transfers or bank login details, reinforcing the legitimacy of the official communication channels.\n\nSearches for recent MOM announcements and policies confirm that biometric registration (fingerprint and photo) is a standard procedure for work permit holders and is required for issuance and renewal of work passes. The deadline mentioned aligns with ongoing updates for 2025 work permit processes.\n\nConclusion: The message is legitimate and consistent with official Ministry of Manpower communications and procedures. Work permit holders in Singapore should comply with the biometric verification requirement by the stated deadline using the official MOM channels provided. The hotline number and website links are authentic and safe to use.",

This is not a solicitation from a lawyer.\n\nYou can learn more at: www.MGMDataSettlement.com\nA $45 million Settlement has been reached in two class action lawsuits against MGM Resorts International (“MGM” or “Defendant”) arising out of two Data Incidents, one that occurred in or around July 2019, and a second separate Data Incident that occurred in or around September 2023 (together, the “Data Incidents”). Varying amounts of Private Information of customers and guests of MGM were accessed in the Data Incidents. The Private Information included names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, and, for a smaller number of individuals, drivers’ license numbers, passport numbers, and Social Security numbers. Only certain people had their Social Security numbers, passport numbers, and/or drivers’ license numbers exposed.\n\nThe purpose of this Notice is to provide information about this Settlement and explain your rights and options.\n\nWho is Included? You are receiving this Email Notice because data provided by MGM indicates your information was included in one of the Data Incidents and you are a Settlement Class Member. The Settlement Class includes all persons in the United States whose Private Information was compromised as a result of the Data Incidents and who were sent notice by the Defendant of the Data Incidents. \n\nWhat does the Settlement Provide?  \n\nDocumented Loss Cash Payment. \nYou may submit a timely and valid Claim Form and provide supporting documentation that you spent money or incurred losses related to the Data Incident for up to $15,000.00. Please visit the website for information and examples on how to file for a Documented Loss Cash Payment.\n \nUse this unique ID number 699CTT67D7 and PIN 2556 to file your Claim online. \n\nYour Cash Payment amount may be subject to a pro rata (a legal term meaning equal share) increase if the amount of Valid Claims received is insufficient to exhaust the entire Settlement Fund. Similarly, in the event the amount of Valid Claims exhausts the amount of the Settlement, the amount of Cash Payments may be reduced pro rata accordingly.  \n\nFinancial Account Monitoring.\nIn addition to the Cash Payments, you can file a Claim for one year of three-bureau identity theft protection, Financial Account Monitoring, and at least $1,000,000 of fraud/identity theft insurance.\n\nAll Settlement Class Members are eligible to file a Claim for Financial Account Monitoring and a Documented Loss Cash Payment, but not every Settlement Class Member is eligible to file a Claim for a Tiered Cash Payment. \n\nYou must submit a timely and valid Claim Form online here or by mail postmarked by June 3, 2025. \n\nOther Options. If you do not want to be legally bound by the Settlement, you must opt out of the Settlement no later than May 19, 2025. If you do not opt out, you will give up the right to sue and will release the Defendant and Released Parties about the legal claims in the lawsuits. If you do not opt out, you may object to the Settlement by May 19, 2025. The Long-Form Notice on the Settlement Website has instructions on how to opt out or object. If you do nothing, you will get no Settlement Class Member Benefits, and you will be bound by the Settlement and any judgments and orders. The Court will hold a Final Approval Hearing on June 18, 2025, to consider whether to approve the Settlement and Class Counsel’s request for attorneys’ fees of up to 30% of the $45 million Settlement Fund, and reimbursement of their litigation costs. Class Counsel will also seek Service Awards for the Class Representatives. You or your lawyer may attend and ask to appear at the hearing, but you are not required to do so. The hearing may be held remotely, and if so, instructions will be at www.MGMDataSettlement.com.\n\nThis notice is a summary. Learn more about the Settlement here or call toll free 1-888-899-8358.",
