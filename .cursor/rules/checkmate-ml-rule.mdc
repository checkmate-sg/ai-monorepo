This project is done on Cloudflare Workers

Use best practices for working on Cloudflare Workers and other edge environments. Note that nodeJS functionalities may not work on edge environments.

Keep your edits well-scoped and concise. Avoid editing multiple files at once unless explicitly told to do so.

Each worker is it's own microservice so to speak. When working on a worker, focus on the files within that worker (the xxx-service or api-entrypoint folder), as well as the shared folder.

If you don't manage to get an expected output, ask me, the developer, for guidance. Don't just keep trying on and on.
